# Understanding Coq - Part 0 - Outline

Hello! This is a series of blog posts that I'm writing for an independent study I did during the Spring 2022 semester with Professors [Sreepathi Pai](https://cs.rochester.edu/~sree/) and [Chen Ding](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cding/) at the University of Rochester. 

The purpose of my independent study was to get a better understanding of how Coq and other theorem provers worked by learning about the type system that powers them, the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CoIC). As a part of the independent study I implemented a type checker and compiler for the CoIC, gave a talk to the [systems group](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/ejohns48/seminar/) within the Computer Science department about the CoIC, and wrote this series of blog posts. 

## Outline

Here's an outline of this series of blogs posts and links to each blog post:

0. [Outline](https://gist.github.com/justinfargnoli/41ab2558183746852e8c30589a4bbbaf) - You're looking at it!
1. [Motivation](https://gist.github.com/justinfargnoli/2c0b67da779ecfe7c47bce494c9dff38) - What are theorem provers and the CoIC? Why are theorem provers like Coq and Lean powerful and interesting programming languages?
2. [The Calculus of Inductive Constructions](https://gist.github.com/justinfargnoli/900e0bd457e8eacfc842a0a154730ff5) - Getting a first look at Coq syntax and the power of the CoIC. Introduce two running examples. 
3. [Type Checking](https://gist.github.com/justinfargnoli/8ded6d3c94bcfa82503ffd329460fd75) - How did I go about type checking the CoIC?
4. [Compilation](https://gist.github.com/justinfargnoli/1ee56d4f9904176b1ea26dffee3b1d24) - How did I go about compiling the CoIC?
5. [Reflections](https://gist.github.com/justinfargnoli/b8837284d9ef53f578405976260b9330) - Was the independent study successful? What did I accomplish? What's left to do?
